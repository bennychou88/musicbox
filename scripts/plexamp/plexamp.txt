Plexamp for Raspberry Pi v2.0 beta 2

We’re pleased to announce the next release of Plexamp for Raspberry Pi, with massive internal changes and improvements. The audio engine inside is the exact same upgraded piece of awesome which powers our iOS and Android apps. Overall, the biggest changes:

    Support for TIDAL and podcasts.
    Lower memory usage.
    Much faster startup of playback in many cases.
    Much faster seeking/track skipping (in many cases instant).
    Pre-buffering of next track.
    Improved sweet Fades (smart overlaps) between tracks.
    Soft fadeout when pausing/skipping.
    Transcoding into Opus for high bitrate remote media.

This is a beta release, so we’d appreciate your feedback on it. We’ll likely be adding more configurability, specifically.

We recommend this hat 170 for digital audio, it’s cheap and high quality.
